[Bulgarian Dialectology as Living Tradition](https://bulgariandialectology.org/):
Between October 2022 and May of 2023, I worked under [Dr. Ronelle Alexander](https://slavic.berkeley.edu/people/ronelle-alexander/) on a project for documenting dialect diversity in Bulgarian via the use of a transcribed spoken corpus of interviews with native speakers across Bulgaria. My job included labeling and tagging syntactic and semantic information from these interviews.
